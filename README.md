# PhysicsGames
3 simple Physics Based Games

Experience requirements:
- **The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player**: Scene1, Scene2, Scene3, Scene4
- **The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact).**: Each games uses physics to complete the game. The player must do physics based challenges which allows the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact.
- **3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).**: Scene game1, scene game2, and scene game3. These are three 3 classes that are each game scenes. Most of the physics are defined in physics.js under the class physicsGame1, physicsGame2, or physicsGame3 since the games implement different physics based functions.
    -
- **Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes**: Use of summary scenes to seperate and contextualize the gameplay scenes.
