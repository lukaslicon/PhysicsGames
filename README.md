3 simple Physics Based Games
Playable Link: https://lukaslicon.github.io/PhysicsGames/

Experience requirements:
- **The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player**: In all scenes player input is needed to do a certain task whether it be move around to collect coins, dodging falling items, or moving a bar to hit a ball. There is lots of continuous inputs but also there are small discrete inputs such as collisions and velocity movement/bounce.
- **The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact).**: Each games uses physics to complete the game. The player must do physics based challenges which allows the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact.
- **3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).**: Scene game1, scene game2, and scene game3. These are three 3 classes that are each game scenes. Under the classes game1, game2, or game3  the games implement different physics for position and contact of players and enemies. There are a lot of collision detection physics, velocity movement, overlapping checks, and player velocity physics for movement.

- **Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes**: Use of summary scenes to seperate and contextualize the gameplay scenes between games to give the player a summary of game they played/score.

Asset sources:
- **Coin**:  https://www.hubpng.com/photo/21279/business-coins-money-stack-salary-stencil-hd-png  This coin was an outline and I colored it in so that it would be yellow on the inside then removed the outside lines they had added.
- **Ship**: https://dribbble.com/shots/3965938-Top-Down-Space-Shooters  I cut image out, made transparent background, changed the green on the ship to blue so that it would match a better space vibe. 
- **Asteroid**: https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/asteroid-icon-cartoon-style-vector-23129163  Removed background, changed colors so that it was a brighter/more white, I also converted it from jpeg to png
- **Hoop**: https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/basketball-hoop-gm451574021-26246448  I cut out the hoops background and then I erased and used a lasso tool to erase the bottom part and make it a perfect circle.
- **Space Background**: https://opengameart.org/content/space-star-background I resized the image to 1920x1080 then I shanged the saturation and hue so that instead of it being a purple color the background was a dark blueish.
- **Court Background**: http://clipart-library.com/clipart/1147897.htm I resized the image, changed the hue again so that it would be different shade and also changed the exposure so it was not as bright as the original image.
- **Game1 Background**: https://www.psdgraphics.com/backgrounds/simple-geometric-design/ I changed all the colors on the image so that instead of an orange/red/yellow and a tiny bit of purple I completely changed all the colors so that it is a heavy amount of blue and a tiny bit of purple.

All other art such as game1 player, game1 enemies, game3 basketball, and game3 bar were made by me using paint.net
