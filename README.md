3 simple Physics Based Games

Experience requirements:
- **The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player**: In all scenes player input is needed to do a certain task whether it be move around to collect coins, dodging falling items, or moving a bar to hit a ball. There is lots of continuous inputs but also there are small discrete inputs such as collisions and velocity movement/bounce.
- **The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact).**: Each games uses physics to complete the game. The player must do physics based challenges which allows the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact.
- **3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).**: Scene game1, scene game2, and scene game3. These are three 3 classes that are each game scenes. Under the classes game1, game2, or game3  the games implement different physics for position and contact of players and enemies. There are a lot of collision detection physics, velocity movement, overlapping checks, and player velocity physics for movement.

- **Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes**: Use of summary scenes to seperate and contextualize the gameplay scenes between games to give the player a summary of game they played/score.
